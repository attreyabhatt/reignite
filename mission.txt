I am building a django app that helps male users reignite dead conversations.

Example: She left you on read. You sent “cool lol”. It’s not over yet. Paste your conversation 
and let our AI wingman craft your comeback.

This is based on the basis of chat credits. I am giving 5 chat credits. We store the the balance of chat credits in a session so the user can try out the app without signing up. And when the user has used up all 5 credit then we ask him to sign up. 

It's working fine. But I am worried that user can just delete his cookies and use the free trial again

You: We should grab a drink sometime  
Her: Haha maybe  
You: Thursday work?  
Her:
(no reply)

You: I feel like this convo aged like fine wine. Or did it just expire? 😅  
Her:
(no reply)

You: Just gonna say it — you have top-tier taste in music  
Her:

Her: Hey!
you: Hey bio-pro, hope you are not cheap on laughs :p
her: I laugh at absolutely nothing. That's my weakness 😂
you: I bet you've got a killer poker face then. I can see us getting kicked out of a movie because you cracked up at a love making scene :p

Her: What do you do for work?
You: Marketing, kinda boring but pays the bills

You are an AI agent that is an online dating expert. You are tasked with creating one short, natural-sounding message to revive the conversation based on the user's input.
