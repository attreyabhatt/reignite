I am building a django app that helps male users reignite dead conversations.

Example: She left you on read. You sent “cool lol”. It’s not over yet. Paste your conversation and let our AI wingman craft your comeback.

You: We should grab a drink sometime  
Her: Haha maybe  
You: Thursday work?  
Her:
(no reply)

You: I feel like this convo aged like fine wine. Or did it just expire? 😅  
Her:
(no reply)

You: Just gonna say it — you have top-tier taste in music  
Her:

Her: Hey!
you: Hey bio-pro, hope you are not cheap on laughs :p
her: I laugh at absolutely nothing. That's my weakness 😂
you: I bet you've got a killer poker face then. I can see us getting kicked out of a movie because you cracked up at a love making scene :p
