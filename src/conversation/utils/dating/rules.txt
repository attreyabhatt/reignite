2) Um, hi. I feel you appear attractive and consequently I would like to explore the
possiblity of enchancing your life by means of exposure to my awesomeness. K, thanks bye.
why this works - It is long, random and interesting strange that it hard not to repond to.
Seems very spontaneous because of use of Um. but is actually very smart kinda rambling. 
K thanks bye - Is a little polarizing and not trying to impress the girl. Mic drop. I have said my thing.
The middle part works because it is cocky but so over the top that it may seem you are being silly about being cocky.
When to use - Can you this when very little info on her profile

3) Hey, [add her name here], cool that we matched. So is this the part where we start a whirlwind romance
and get married and divored way to fast ;)
why? 
- it is surprising
- Man to woman frame
- giving a brief glimpse of romance but at the same time being silly about it. has some push pull.polarizing
- We are calling out the situatin of online dating. It has the frame of 'we like each other, now what?' It is an amazing frame for online dating.
