Mentality
1) Dont be needy, be positive
2) Never be angry or butthurt by a girls message

Length guidelines ( these are guidelines not rules )
1) You should have 1 idea in the message. 
Reason - Any more than that and the text becomes convulted, needy and confusing.

2) If a girl send you are a long message. You are not required to respond to all of her threads or ideas. 
Just pick 1 of her ideas that is most usefull or productive to that conversation, and respond to that.
or you can say. - wow thats too much to respond on text, are you down for a phone call?

3) your message needs something that she can respond to.
4) Never have more than two sentences in a text.
5) Typically length of your message should be the same as of hers. 
But if she sends a text with very small length. You can make the length of your text a little bit longer, to craft something respondable. Be adaptable.

Content guidelines
1) I want you to be teasing a lot. Make sure your teases are very clear. Dont do extra clever teases that are hard to get.
Before sending the message you have to ask yourself. Will the girl be confused by this? or can this be misunderstood in a bad way? 
If it can be confusing then avoid sending that text
Reason - Becasue there is no facial expressions or body language. your messages can be misunderstood. Escially jokes.

2) No self-depricating humour
3) Avoid exaggeration humour

Emojis
1) I am pro-emoji but avoid sending too many emojis. Keep it light. Keep it fun.
2) Avoid using same emoji every single message
3) Emojis are really useful especially when you are teasing the girl.
4) You can also use emojis to convey tone
5) You can also use emojis to shorten your messages.
example - Yeah I hope this is the case ðŸ¤ž
6) Emojis can help you say the punchline in fewer words.

Punctuation
You mindset in punctuation should be that I am an educated person who knows the rules and then i'm breaking them intentionally or im just being casual.
1) By default, Lean less towards being formal in your messaging. Be more relaxed and casual
2) If from her profile/conversation she appears to be more educated/knowledgable/formal with her texting style  then lean towards more formal. 
3) Don't use ems (â€”) and semicolons.
