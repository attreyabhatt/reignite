    <h1 class="mb-4">ScreenClean Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: February 13, 2026</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <b>ScreenClean</b> handles information when you use the app.
        ScreenClean is a screenshot cleanup app that helps you find and remove screenshots from your device.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">1. Information We Access</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Photos and screenshots on your device:</b> Used only to detect, sort, and help you delete screenshots.</li>
        <li><b>Basic app preferences:</b> Stored locally on your device (for example app settings).</li>
        <li><b>Analytics data:</b> If enabled, we use Google Analytics to collect usage events such as feature interactions, app version, device model, and approximate region.</li>
        <li><b>Advertising data (if ads are enabled):</b> Ads are served through Google AdMob, which may process device identifiers and usage data under its own policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Information</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>To scan your screenshots and show cleanup suggestions.</li>
        <li>To delete screenshots only when you confirm deletion.</li>
        <li>To improve app stability and user experience.</li>
        <li>To understand feature usage and improve the app using analytics trends.</li>
        <li>To display ads when enabled in the app build.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="mt-4">3. Local Processing</h5>
    <p>
        ScreenClean is designed to process screenshot analysis on your device. We do not upload your screenshots
        to our servers for scanning or cleanup operations.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">4. Permissions</h5>
    <p>
        ScreenClean requests photo/media access so it can find screenshots in your gallery. If you deny this
        permission, screenshot scanning features will not work.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">5. Third-Party Services</h5>
    <p>
        ScreenClean may use third-party services such as Google Analytics for usage analytics and Google AdMob
        for advertising. These services may collect and process data according to their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">6. Data Sharing</h5>
    <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We only share data when required for service delivery (such as ad serving)
        or if required by law.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">7. Data Retention</h5>
    <p>
        Any local app data remains on your device unless you remove the app or clear app data. We do not maintain
        a cloud account or server profile for ScreenClean users.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">8. Children's Privacy</h5>
    <p>
        ScreenClean is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information
        from children.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">9. Changes to This Policy</h5>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page.
    </p>
